# PULSE 
# (People Uniting for Local Security and Environment)

A simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to report and track issues in their locality. Users can sign up, log in, post issues they observe around them, and update the status of their own reported issues. All users can view issues reported by others to stay informed about what's happening in their community.
